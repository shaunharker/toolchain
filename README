toolchain -- Shaun Harker June 12, 2014

SYNOPSIS
--------

This is a basically a bunch of scripts to help you
install open-source software.

It has
* Bash Profile scripts
* Download scripts
* Build scripts

Bash Profile scripts
--------------------
There are bash scripts to set your environment. If you
already have important stuff in your bash scripts, you should
make backups and merge them together.

Essentially the bash script will:
* give you a funky colored prompt
* export variables MYHOME COMPILERDIR COMPILER

Download scripts
----------------
The download script will create a folder

-->   ./toolchain/tarballs

and download the open source projects listed in
"config/sources.txt" into it.
(There is a file called bigsources.txt that has a larger list.)

Another script ./decompress with unpack the tarballs into
a folder 

-->   ./toolchain/software


Build Scripts
-------------
There is a build script which checks the name
of what you are attempting to build.

Generically it will try to install in

-->   $MYHOME/opt


There is a special build option

./build native

which will attempt to install $COMPILER

into $COMPILERDIR/$COMPILER

(as of this moment it is hardwired to only work
for gcc-4.9.0 but this will change)

Linux-From-Scratch
------------------
I was also playing around trying to get Linux-From-Scratch to
work, except without being chrooted. So far I have not been
succesful so for the time being do ignore the linux-from-scratch
scripts!
