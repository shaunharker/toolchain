toolchain -- Shaun Harker June 12, 2014

SYNOPSIS
--------

This is a basically a bunch of scripts to help you
install open-source software. The rationale is that
things go wrong often. If you are trying to build
compilers, or glibc, or linux tools, then you are 
likely to make mistakes and have to redo things.
Having scripts you can tweak and simply rerun
the scripts is a big time saver compared to 
redoing everything by hand.

It has
* Bash Profile scripts
* Download scripts
* Build scripts

Bash Profile scripts
--------------------
There are bash scripts to set your environment if you
want. The requirement is that you export a variable TOOLCHAIN
and put the $TOOLCHAIN/usr/bin:$TOOLCHAIN/usr/local/bin
on your $PATH. This is where things will be installed.

Download scripts
----------------
The download script will create a folder

-->   $TOOLCHAIN/tarballs

and download the open source projects listed in
"config/sources.txt" into it.
(There is a file called bigsources.txt that has a larger list.)

Another script ./decompress with unpack the tarballs into
a folder 

-->   $TOOLCHAIN/software


Build Scripts
-------------
There is a build script which checks the name
of what you are attempting to build. Based on the
name, it either installs the software into 

-->   $TOOLCHAIN/usr/

or 

-->   $TOOLCHAIN/usr/local


There are special build scripts for:
gcc
glibc
binutils

These are the packages which install into $TOOLCHAIN/usr.
They have specialized build instructions. In particular,
they require ./configure and make to be executed in a 
separate build folder.

All others install into $TOOLCHAIN/usr/local.
For example, "./build bash" would find the highest version 
bash in $TOOLCHAIN/software and proceed to build it and install it
in $TOOLCHAIN/usr/local
