toolchain -- Shaun Harker June 12, 2014

SYNOPSIS
--------

This is a basically a bunch of scripts to help you
install open-source software.

It has
* Bash Profile scripts
* Download scripts
* Build scripts

Bash Profile scripts
--------------------
There are bash scripts to set your environment if you
want. The requirement is that you export a variable TOOLCHAIN
and put the $TOOLCHAIN/usr/bin:$TOOLCHAIN/usr/local/bin
on your $PATH. This is where things will be installed.

Download scripts
----------------
The download script will create a folder

-->   $TOOLCHAIN/tarballs

and download the open source projects listed in
"config/sources.txt" into it.
(There is a file called bigsources.txt that has a larger list.)

Another script ./decompress with unpack the tarballs into
a folder 

-->   $TOOLCHAIN/software


Build Scripts
-------------
There is a build script which checks the name
of what you are attempting to build.

-->   $TOOLCHAIN/usr/local


There is a special build option

./build native

which will attempt to install gcc-4.9.0
into 


-->   $TOOLCHAIN/usr

Linux-From-Scratch
------------------
I was also playing around trying to get Linux-From-Scratch to
work, except without being chrooted. So far I have not been
succesful so for the time being do ignore the linux-from-scratch
scripts!
